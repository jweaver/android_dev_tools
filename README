1. colorizedlogcat.py
	- Python script meant to colorize output on the terminal from logcat.  This was originally forked, but since then the following has been added:
	  1. -t argument to introduce a timstamp in the 2nd column.
	  2. line numbering
	- Todo:
	  1. Next an argument needs to be specified to turn the line numbering on/off.  This is in an attempt to better support monitors with smaller resolutions and can't fit the buffer on one line.
	  2. Fix this readme to be better presented @ github.
