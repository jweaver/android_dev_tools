* Android Developer Tools
A package of simple developer tools, some addons to existing tools already out there, but likely extended for additional functionality.

I'm looking for ideas on other tools which can be added or created for this suite.

1. *colorizedlogcat.py*
- Python script meant to colorize output on the terminal from logcat.  This was originally forked, but since then the following has been added:
    1. -t argument to introduce a timstamp in the 2nd column.
    2. line numbering
    3. Usage print-out
- Todo:
    1. Next an argument needs to be specified to turn the line numbering on/off.  This is in an attempt to better support monitors with smaller resolutions and can't fit the buffer on one line.
    2. Look into passing activity names and RGB values for custom out colors as parameters.
